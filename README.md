# MastoShell

MastoShell is a GNOME Shell theme inspired by the Mastodon brand colors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/andypiper/MastoShell.git
    ```

2. Copy the folder to the GNOME themes directory:
    ```sh
    cp -r MastoShell ~/.themes/
    ```

3. Use GNOME Tweaks to select the MastoShell theme.

## Note

Conflicts with / will not appear to make any change if the Blur My Shell extension is installed (that overrides the theme with a blurred background image instead).
